        <h3 class="skillHeading">HTML</h3>
        <p class="paraHeading"></p>I began learning HTML in 2022 during the first year of my diploma. As a part of my syllabus, it quickly became one of the subjects I enjoyed the most. I found it simple yet powerful, and ever since, I've continued to use HTML to create structured and user-friendly web pages.<hr>

        <h3 class="skillHeading">CSS</h3>
        <p class="paraHeading">I began studying basic CSS alongside HTML, but it was during my UI/UX design course that I truly understood how essential styling is for user experience. This pushed me to master CSS, which I did by learning from YouTube and applying it in real projects.</p><hr>

        <h3 class="skillHeading">JavaScript</h3>
        <p class="paraHeading">My passion for web development led me to explore JavaScript after gaining a solid foundation in HTML and CSS. I started by learning the basics from YouTube, and now Iâ€™m diving deeper into the language to enhance the functionality and interactivity of my web projects.</p><hr>

        <h3 class="skillHeading">UI/UX Designing</h3>
        <p class="paraHeading">I pursued a UI/UX Design course in 2024, where I discovered how creative and detail-oriented I truly am. Through this course, I mastered the fundamentals of prototyping and wireframing. The experience empowered me to take the initiative and conduct a solo workshop for my juniors in college, helping them understand the basics of UI/UX design.</p><hr>

        <h3 class="skillHeading">Python</h3>
        <p class="paraHeading">Python had always been on my learning wishlist, and I was thrilled when it became part of my final year curriculum. I embraced the opportunity and developed a web application for my final project using Flask. Now, I'm continuing my journey with Python by learning machine learning to unlock its full potential in data-driven projects.</p><hr>

        <h3 class="skillHeading">MongoDB</h3>
        <p class="paraHeading">During my engineering studies, I learned about relational databases like MySQL and practiced with PostgreSQL. But when I came across MongoDB, I was impressed by how simple and powerful it was for handling data. I learned it through YouTube tutorials and now use it in projects that require flexible and scalable database solutions.</p>
